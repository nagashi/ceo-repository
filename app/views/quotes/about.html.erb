  <p>
    Splurty was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/nagashi">Charles "Chas" O'Riley</a>. He is an aspiring web designer and data enthusiast who is passionate about mastering his craft.  "What is design?" I do believe design is creating an artistic or skillful solution to solve a given problem.  Itâ€™s not purely aesthetic or purely functional, but a combination of both to serve a specific purpose.
